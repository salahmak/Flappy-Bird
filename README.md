# SFML Flappy Bird

> A Flappy Bird game clone made using the SFML libraries in C++, my first game ever.

## :package: Installation

<ol>
<li>
	Install the dependencies to build and run the game

### Debian, Ubuntu...

```
sudo apt install libsfml-dev cmake
```

### Arch, Manjaro...

```
sudo pacman -S sfml cmake
```

### Windows
Download the compiled binaries from the releases section
(I don't think it would be stable on windows since I made it on linux in first place)

</li>

<li>
	Download and compile the game

```
git clone https://github.com/salahmak/Flappy-Bird
cd Flappy-Bird
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Now the game is compiled and you only need to run the executable:
```
./Flappy-Bird
```
or
```
make run
```

</li>
</ol>
